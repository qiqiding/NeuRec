NeuRec is a comprehensive and flexible Python library for recommendation models that includes a large range of state-of-the-art neural recommender models. This library aims to solve general and sequential (i.e. next-item) recommendation tasks, using the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library to provide 26 models out of the box. NeuRec is [open source](https://opensource.org) and available under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Features

* **Cross platform** - run on any operating system with the available Docker images;
* **State-of-the-art** - 26 neural recommender models available out of the box;
* **Flexible configuration** - easily change the configuration settings to your exact requirements;
* **Easy expansion** - quickly include models or datasets into NeuRec;
* **Fast execution** - naturally supports GPU, with a mutli-thread evaluator;
* **Detailed documentation** - extensive documentation available as Jupyter notebooks at /docs.

## Architecture

The architecture of NeuRec is shown in the diagram below:

## Quick start

Start using NeuRec in three steps with pip.

Firstly, create a properties files to configure NeuRec, including all the necessary settings inside this file:

```bash
vim neurec.properties
```

Secondly, install NeuRec using pip:

```bash
pip3 install neurec
```

Finally, import NeuRec and run as follows:

```python
import neurec

neurec.setup('neurec.properties')
neurec.run()
```

> Additional installation methods, including via Docker, are available at **/docs/1. Installation.ipynb**

## Models
